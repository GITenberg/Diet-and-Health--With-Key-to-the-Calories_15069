<h2>Read This First</h2>
<p>I am sorry I cannot devise a key by which to read this book, as
well as a Key to the Calories, for sometimes you are to read the
title headings and side explanations before the text. Other times
you are supposed to read the text and then the headings. It really
does not matter much as long as you read them both. Be sure to do
that. They are clever. <i>I wrote them myself</i>.</p>
<p>I have been accused of trying to catch you coming and going,
because I have included in my book the right methods of gaining
weight, as well as those for losing weight. But this is not the
reason&mdash;though I don't object to doing that little
thing&mdash;the reason is that the lack of knowledge of foods is
the foundation for both overweight and underweight.</p>
<p>I did want my publishers to get this out in a cheaper edition,
thinking that more people could have it, and thus it would be doing
more good; but they have convinced me that that idea was a false
claim of my mortal mind, and that the more you paid for it, the
more you would appreciate it. I have received many times, and
without grumbling on my part, ten dollars for the same advice given
in my office. Perhaps on this line of reasoning we should have ten
dollars for the book. Those of you who think so may send the
balance on through my publishers.</p>

<h3><i>Are You Thin and Do You Want to Gain?</i></h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Don't Read This</i></div>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/010.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>Skip this chapter. It will not interest you in the least. I will
come to you later. I am not particularly interested in you anyway,
for I cannot get your point of view. How any one can want to be
anything but thin is beyond my intelligence. However, knowing that
there are such deluded individuals, I have been constrained to give
you advice. You won't find it spontaneous nor from the heart, but
if you follow my directions I will guarantee that you will gain;
providing, of course, you have no organic trouble; and the chances
are that by giving proper attention to your diet you will gain
anyway, and maybe in passing lose your trouble. Who knows?</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Bad Business</i></div>
<p>In war time it is a crime to hoard food, and fines and
imprisonment have followed the expos&eacute; of such practices. Yet
there are hundreds of thousands of individuals all over America who
are hoarding food, and that one of the most precious of all foods!
<i>They have vast amounts of this valuable commodity stored away in
their own anatomy</i>.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><br />
<img src="images/011a.png" width="40%" alt="" title="" />
<br />
<br /></div>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/011b.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>Now fat individuals have always been considered a joke, but you
are a joke no longer. Instead of being looked upon with friendly
tolerance and amusement, you are now viewed with distrust,
suspicion, and even aversion! How dare you hoard fat when our
nation needs it? You don't dare to any longer. You never wanted to
be fat anyway, but you did not know how to reduce, and it is
proverbial how little you eat. Why, there is Mrs. Natty B. Slymm,
who is beautifully thin, and she eats twice as much as you do, and
does not gain an ounce. You know positively that eating has nothing
to do with it, for one time you dieted, didn't eat a thing but what
the doctor ordered, besides your regular meals, and you actually
gained.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/012.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>You are in despair about being anything but fat, and&mdash;! how
you hate it. But cheer up. I will save you; yea, even as I have
saved myself and many, many others, so will I save you.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Spirituality vs. Materiality</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Long, Long Battle</i></div>
<p>It is not in vain that all my life I have had to fight the too,
too solid. Why, I can remember when I was a child I was always
being consoled by being told that I would outgrow it, and that when
I matured I would have some shape. Never can I tell pathetically
"when I was married I weighed only one hundred eighteen, and look
at me now." No, I was a delicate slip of one hundred and sixty-five
when I was taken.</p>
<p>I never will tell you how much I have weighed, I am so
thoroughly ashamed of it, but my normal weight is one hundred and
fifty pounds, and at one time there was seventy pounds more of me
than there is now, or has been since I knew how to control it. I
was not so shameless as that very long, and as I look back upon
that short period I feel like refunding the comfortable salary
received as superintendent of an hospital; for I know I was only
sixty-five per cent efficient, for efficiency decreases in direct
proportion as excess weight increases. Everybody knows it.</p>
<h3><i>The Meeting Is Now Open for Discussion</i></h3>
<p>Jolly Mrs. Sheesasite has the floor and wants some questions
answered. You know Mrs. Sheesasite; her husband recently bought her
a pair of freight scales.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Mrs. Sheesasite</i></div>
<p>"Why is it, Doctor, that thin people can eat so much more than
fat people and still not gain?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Me Answering</i></div>
<p>"First: Thin people are usually more active than fat people and
use up their food.</p>
<p>"Second: Thin people have been proved to radiate fifty per cent
more heat per pound than fat people; in other words, fat people are
regular fireless cookers! They hold the heat in, it cannot get out
through the packing, and the food which is also contained therein
goes merrily on with fiendish regularity, depositing itself as
fat.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><br />
<br />
<img src="images/014a.png" width="40%" alt="" title="" />
<br /></div>
<p>"And there are baby fireless cookers and children fireless
cookers. The same dietetic rules apply to them as to the
adult."</p>
<p>"I recognize Mrs. Tiny Weyaton; then you, Mrs. Knott
Little."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Mrs. Weyaton</i></div>
<p>"We have heard you say that fat people eat too much, and still
we eat so little?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Me Again</i></div>
<p>"Yes, you eat too much, <i>no matter how little it is</i>, even
if it be only one bird-seed daily, <i>if you store it away as
fat</i>. For, hearken; food, and food only (sometimes plus alcohol)
maketh fat. Not water&mdash;not air&mdash;verily, nothing but food
maketh fat. (And between you and me, Mrs. Weyaton, just
confidential like&mdash;don't tell it&mdash;we know that the small
appetite story is a myth.)"</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/014b.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Mrs. Knott Little</i></div>
<p>"But, Doctor, is it not true that some individuals inherit the
tendency to be fat, and can not help it, no matter what they
do?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Doctor</i></div>
<p>"Answer to first part&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>"Answer to second part&mdash;No! It is not true that they cannot
help it; they have to work a little harder, that is all. It is true
that being fat is a disease with some, due to imperfect working of
the internal secretory glands, such as the thyroid, generative
glands, etc.; but that is not true fat such as you have. Yours, and
that of the other members who are interested, is due to overeating
and underexercising.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Not</i>?</div>
<p>"Those diseased individuals should be under the care of a
physician. Probably the secretory glands are somewhat inactive or
sluggish in the healthy fat individual. I use the word
<i>healthy</i> here in contradistinction to the other type. In
reality, individuals very much overweight are not really healthy,
and they should also visit their physician."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Ima Gobbler?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Mrs. Ima Gobbler</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Doctor Dear</i></div>
<p>"But, Doctor dear, what's the use of dieting? I only get fatter
after I stop."</p>
<p>(Answering delicate like, for I'm fond of her and she is
sensitive):</p>
<p>"You fat&mdash;! You make me fatigued! <i>You never diet long
enough</i> to get out of the fireless cooker class. <i>If you did,
you wouldn't."</i></p>
<p>"Is there anyone else who would like to be recognized? No?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Nothing That I Don't Know</i></div>
<p>It is well. I will probably answer more as I go along, for there
is nothing that I don't know or haven't studied or tried in the
reducing line. I know everything you have to contend with&mdash;how
you no sooner congratulate yourself on your will power, after you
have dragged yourself by the window with an exposure of luscious
fat chocolates with curlicues on their tummies, than another comes
into view, and you have it all to go through with again, and how
you finally succumb.</p>
<p>I hope sometime it will be a misdemeanor, punishable by
imprisonment, to display candy as shamelessly as it is done.</p>
<p>Many fond parents think that candy causes worms. It doesn't, of
course, unless it is contaminated with worm eggs, but, personally,
I wish every time I ate a chocolate I would get a worm, then I
would escape them. The chocolates, I mean. I will tell you more
about worms when I discuss meat.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Vampires</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Malicious Animal Magnetism?</i></div>
<p>I know how you go down to destruction for peanuts, with their
awful fat content. It is terrible, the lure a peanut has for me. Do
you suppose Mr. Darwin could explain that?</p>
<p>Perhaps I was a little too delicate like in my answer to Mrs.
Gobbler's question,&mdash;What's the use of dieting, she only gets
fatter after she stops?</p>
<p>So many ask me that question, with the further pathetic
addition,&mdash;Will they always have to keep it up? And it ever
irritates me.</p>
<p>The answer is,&mdash;Yes! You will always have to keep up
dieting, just as you always have to keep up other things in life
that make it worth living&mdash;being neat, being kind, being
tender; reading, studying, loving.</p>
<p>You will not have to be nearly so strenuous after you get to
normal; <i>but you might as well recognize now, and accept it as a
fact, that neither you nor anybody else will be able to eat beyond
your needs without accumulating fat or disease, or both.</i></p>
<p>I love Billy Sunday's classical answer to the objection that his
conversions were not permanent. He responded: "Neither is a
bath!"</p>
<h3>WHEN YOU START TO REDUCE</h3>
<p>you will have the following to combat:</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Combat</i></div>
<p>First: Your husband, who tells you that he does not like thin
women. I almost hate my husband when I think how long he kept me
under that delusion. Now, of course, I know all about his jealous
disposition, and how he did not want me to be attractive.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/018a.png" width="30%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>Second: Your sister, who says, "Goodness, Lou, but you look old
today; you looked lots better as you were."</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/018b.png" width="30%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>Third: Your friends, who tell you that you are just right now;
don't lose another pound! And other friends who tell you cheerful
tales of people they have known who reduced, and who went into a
decline, and finally died.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>To Avoid Slack in Your Neck, Double and
Triple Chins, Massage Vigorously Up and Down, Not
Crossways</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>I Am Interesting</i></div>
<p>But you must not mind them. Smile, and tell them that you know
all about it, and don't worry. Go serenely on your way, confident
in your heart that you will look fully ten years younger when you
get down to normal, no matter how you look in the interim. I don't
see why women, and men, too, (secretly) worry so much about
wrinkles. If the increased wrinkles on the face are accompanied by
increased wrinkles in the gray matter, 'tis a consummation devoutly
to be wished. I'm sure I am much more interesting with wrinkles
than I was without. I am to myself, anyway.</p>
<p>However, you will not be any more wrinkled if you reduce
gradually, as I advise, and keep up your exercises at least fifteen
minutes daily.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>I Have a Beautiful Complexion</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>I Attended an Art School Six Months
Once</i></div>
<p>Take care of your face, alternate hot and cold water, glycerine
one-quarter, rose water three-quarters, cold cream packs, massage
gently, a little ice&mdash;you know what to do&mdash;you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">need not fear. You will not only
look ten</span><br />
years younger and live twenty years longer&mdash;I assert it
boldly&mdash;but your complexion and efficiency will be one hundred
per cent better.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Joy</i>!</div>
<p>If there is anything comparable to the joy of taking in your
clothes, I have not experienced it. And when you find your corset
coming closer and closer together (I advise a front lace, so this
can be watched), and then the day you realize that you will have to
stitch in a tuck or get a new one!</p>
<p>But don't be in a hurry to make your clothes smaller now. If
they are loose they will show to the world that you are reducing. A
fat person in a tight suit, unless it is perfectly new, should be
interned.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Food Only</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Impossible</i></div>
<p>I have said that food, and food only, causes fat. That gives you
the cue to what you must do to get rid of it. No anti-fat medicines
unless under the supervision of your scientific, educated
physician. They are dangerous; most of them contain thyroid
extract, arsenic, or mercury. Even the vendors of these harmful
compounds in their advertisements are now saying to "stop harmful
drugging," but urge you to adopt their particular delightful
product, and, "without dieting or exercises, you will positively
reduce," and so forth.</p>
<p>No drastic purges, no violent exercises, especially at first,
and not too frequent nor prolonged Turkish baths. Epsom salts baths
have little effect. If salts are used habitually internally, they
are harmful. All of these are unscientific and unsuccessful, and
the things they bring on are worse than the fat.</p>
<p>Now, if food is the only source of body substance, you see that
you must study that question, and that is what I will give
you&mdash;some lessons on foods and their values.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Candy Cake, Pie, Rich Meats, Thick Gravy,
Bread, Butter, Nuts, Ice Cream</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Whipped Cream, Candied Sweet
Potatoes</i></div>
<p>Heretofore you have known only in a dumb, despairing sort of way
that all the foods you like are fattening, and all the advice you
read and hear is that you must avoid them as a pestilence. And you
settle down to your joyless fatness, realizing that it is beyond
human strength to do that forever, and that you would rather die
young and fat, anyway, than to have nothing to eat all your life
but a little meat, fish, and sloshy vegetables. Study on, and you
will find the reason your favorite foods are fattening.</p>
<p>But cast off your dejection. <i>You don't have to avoid
them</i>!</p>
<p>Eat what you like and grow thin? Yes; follow me. I know it will
be an exertion, but you must persist and go through with it.
Nothing in life worth while is attained without some effort. So
begin now; it is the price of liberty.</p>

<div class='center'>Definition to learn:</div>
<p>CALORIE; symbol C.; a heat unit and food value unit; is that
amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of water 4 degrees
Fahrenheit.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Pronounced Kal'-o-ri</i></div>
<p>There is a good deal of effort expended by many semi-educated
individuals to discredit the knowledge of calories, saying that it
is a foolish food science, a fallacy, a fetish, and so forth.</p>
<p>They reason, or rather say, that because there are no calories
in some of the very vital elements of foods&mdash;the vitamines and
the mineral salts&mdash;therefore it is not necessary to know about
them. They further argue that their grandfathers never heard of
calories and they got along all right. That grandfather argument
always enrages my mortal mind.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Unit of Measure</i></div>
<p>Now you know that a calorie is a unit of measuring heat and
food. It is not heat, not food; simply a unit of measure. And as
food is of supreme importance, certainly a knowledge of how it
should be measured is also of supreme importance.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Yes, They Are Kosher</i></div>
<p>You should know and also use the word calorie as frequently, or
more frequently, than you use the words foot, yard, quart, gallon,
and so forth, as measures of length and of liquids. Hereafter you
are going to eat calories of food. Instead of saying one slice of
bread, or a piece of pie, you will say 100 Calories of bread, 350
Calories of pie.</p>
<p>The following is the way the calorie is determined:</p>
<p>An apparatus known as the bomb calorimeter has two chambers, the
inner, which contains the dry food to be burned, say a definite
amount of sugar, and an outer, which is filled with water. The food
is ignited with an electric connection and burned. This heat is
transferred to the water. When one pound of water is raised 4
degrees Fahrenheit, the amount of heat used is arbitrarily chosen
as the unit of heat, and is called the Calorie.</p>
<p>Food burned (oxydized) in the body has been proved to give off
approximately the same amount of heat or energy as when burned in
the calorimeter.</p>

<p>Can you see now why fats are valuable? Why they make fat more
than any other food? They give off more than two and one-fourth
times as much heat, or energy, as the other foods.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>See Next Chapter for Definitions</i></div>
<p>Notice that protein and carbohydrates have the same food value
as to heat or energy, each 113 Calories to the dry ounce. However,
they are not interchangeable; that is, carbohydrates will not take
the place of protein for protein is absolutely necessary to build
and repair tissue, and carbohydrates cannot do that. But fats and
carbohydrates are interchangeable as fuel or energy foods.</p>
<h3><i>Calories Needed per Day for Normal Individuals</i></h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Business of Growing</i></div>
<p>This depends upon age, weight, and physical activities; the baby
and the growing child needing many more calories per pound per day
than the adult, who has to supply only his energy and repair needs.
The aged require still less than the young adult. As to weight; I
have told you why overweight individuals need so little. As to
physical activities; the more active, obviously the more calories
needed, for every movement consumes calories.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Many Know Nothing of This</i></div>
<p>The Maine lumbermen, for instance, while working during the
winter months, consume from 5000 to 8000 Calories per day. But they
do a tremendous amount of physical work.</p>
<p><i>Mental work does not require added nourishment.</i> This has
been proved, and if an excess be taken over what is needed at rest
(if considerable exercise is not taken while doing the mental work)
the work is not so well done.</p>

<h3><i>Example of Finding Number of Calories Needed</i></h3>
<p>1. Determine normal weight by rule.</p>
<p>2. Multiply normal weight by number of calories needed per pound
per day.</p>
<p>For example, say you weigh 220 or 125 lbs., but by the rule for
your height your weight should be 150 lbs.; then 150 would be the
number you would use.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Work Out Your Requirements</i></div>
<p>By the rule I have given, adults require 15-20 Calories per
pound per day, depending upon activity. For example, if you have no
physical activities, then take the lowest figure, 15.
150x15&mdash;2250. Therefore your requirement, if your weight
should be 150, is 2250 Calories per day.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to lose, cut down 500-1000 Calories per day
from that.</p>
<p>Five hundred Calories equal approximately 2 ounces of fat. Two
ounces per day would be about 4 pounds per month, or 48 pounds per
year. Cutting out 1000 Calories per day would equal a reduction of
approximately 8 pounds per month, or 96 pounds per year. These
pounds you can absolutely lose by having a knowledge of food values
(calories) and regulating your intake accordingly. You can now see
the importance of a knowledge of calories.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>1&nbsp;

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><i>1/8 lb. fat&nbsp; 500

<p>If you want to gain, add gradually 500-1000 Calories per
day.</p>
<h3><i>Review</i></h3>
<p>1. Define Calorie, and tell how determined.</p>
<p>2. How many C. in 1 oz. fat? of carbohydrates? of protein?</p>
<p>3. Why are fats so fattening?</p>
<p>4. How many C. per day do you require? do mental workers?</p>
<p>5. Upon what do C. needed per day for normal individuals depend?

<p>These elements are contained largely in the outer coatings of
grains, fruits, and vegetables, and in animal foods and their
products. Do not pare potatoes before cooking. Cook vegetables in a
small amount of water, saving the water for soups and sauces.</p>
<p>WATER: The universal solvent, absolutely necessary for life.</p>
<p>Contained in purest form in all vegetables and fruits. The
average person needs, in addition, from three to five pints taken
as a drink. If not sure of the purity, boil. Do not drink while
food is in the mouth.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Absolutely Necessary for Growth</i></div>
<p>VITAMINES: Health preservers. Vital substances necessary for
growth. The chemistry of these products is at present not
thoroughly understood, but their importance has been demonstrated
by experiments (not torture) on animals. By this work we know that
diseases like beri-beri, scurvy, rickets, and probably pellagra,
are due to a lack of these vital elements in the food, and from
that fact these are called "deficiency" diseases.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Guinea Pigs vs. Babies</i></div>
<p>Of course I realize that nations can be saved from horrible
diseases, and hundreds and thousands of babies saved from death,
through this experimentation on a few guinea pigs and other
animals; but what is the life of a baby compared with the happiness
of a guinea pig? Down with animal experimentation! Let us do
everything in our power to hamper scientific work of this kind. We
are giving up our husbands, fathers, sons, perhaps to die, for the
cause of humanity, but a guinea pig! Horrors!</p>
<p>It has been found that the vitamines, like the minerals, are
most abundant in the outer coverings and the germ of grains, and in
fruits and vegetables. They are also present in fresh milk, butter,
meat and eggs. Babies fed pasteurized or boiled milk should have
fruit juices and vegetable purees early. Begin with one-half
teaspoonful, well diluted, and gradually increase the feeding to an
ounce or more between meals once or twice daily.</p>
<p>Most animal fats have the vitamines, but vegetable fats are
deficient in them. That is the reason cod liver oil is better for
some therapeutic uses than olive oil.</p>

<p>Two and one-fifth ounces dry protein equals the approximate
amount of protein in 10 ounces lean meat, fish, or fowl, or 9
ounces cheese, or 9 eggs. (You should not take all of your proteins
in any of these single forms.) Two and one-half ounces fat equals
approximately 5 pats of butter.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>If Appetite Not Perverted</i></div>
<p>But listen! You don't have to bother with all this fussy stuff.
<i>Be careful not to over-or under-eat of the proteins</i>, and
your tastes will be a fair standard for the rest. You should
remember that a balanced diet contains some of all these foods, in
about the proportions given, and that, while <i>watery vegetables
and fruits contain very few calories, they contain very important
mineral salts, vitamines, and cellulose.</i> The latter is good for
the daily scrub of the intestinal tract.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Pretty Nearly Universal Error</i></div>
<p>CONSTIPATION is many times caused by a too concentrated diet, or
one containing too little roughage. It has also been discovered
that some individuals who are troubled with faulty elimination
digest this cellulose, and only the more resistant, like bran, is
not absorbed. For those, the Japanese seaweed called agaragar in
the laboratory, but more familiarly known as agar by the layman, is
excellent. The most industrious digestive tract apparently can not
digest that. It has the further property of absorbing a large
amount of water, thus increasing its bulk.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>C.S.</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Have Enough Water, Else You'll Choke to
Death. I Did Once</i></div>
<p>Mineral oils (refined paraffine) also are not absorbable, and
they act with benefit in some cases. About the worst thing to do,
in general, is to take physics constantly. These are not physics,
however; they act mechanically. Even the C.S. (common-sense?)
individual can take these. The agar may be taken two or three
heaping teaspoonfuls in a large glass of water before retiring, or
in the morning before breakfast, or in lieu of 4 o'clock tea. Drink
it down rapidly&mdash;for goodness' sake, don't try to chew it.</p>
<p>Mineral oil will make fine mayonnaise dressing. It has little or
no food value, so the constipated overweight individual may indulge
freely. For faulty elimination, then&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Correct diet.</p>
<p>2. Exercise&mdash;especially brisk walking.</p>
<p>3. Regularity of habit.</p>
<p>4. Possibly the addition of bran, agar, or mineral oils.</p>
<p>5. Sweet disposition. Mean people are always constipated.</p>

<h3>More Keys and More Calories</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>List of Foods to Follow</i></div>
<p>The following list probably does not contain all of the foods
you might like and want to know about, but from those named you can
judge of the food value of others. In general, the caloric value,
and therefore the fattening value, depends upon the amount of fat
and the degree of concentration.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Important</i></div>
<p>But remember this point: <i>Any food eaten beyond what your
system requires for its energy, growth, and repair, is fattening,
or is an irritant, or both</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Moderate Sized Chocolate Cream</i></div>
<p>If a food contains much fat, you will know that it is high in
food value, for fat has two and one-quarter times the caloric value
that proteins and carbohydrates have. Dry foods are high in value,
for they are concentrated and contain little water. Compare the
quantity of two heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar, a concentrated food,
and one and one-half pounds of lettuce, a watery vegetable, each
having the same caloric value. A moderate sized chocolate cream is
not only concentrated but has considerable fat in the
chocolate.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Enuf Sed</i></div>
<p>It is not necessary to know accurately the caloric values. In
fact, authorities differ in some of their computations. The list is
not mathematically correct, but it will give you a good idea of the
relative values, and is accurate enough for our purposes. I have
purposely given round numbers, where possible, in order to make
them more easily remembered.</p>
<p>In reckoning made dishes, such as puddings and sauces, you must
compute the different ingredients approximately. About how much
sugar it has, how much fat to the dish, and so on. In reckoning any
food, if you are reducing, give it the benefit of the doubt on the
high count; and if trying to gain, count it low.</p>
<p>It is well, if you are much overweight or underweight, to have
some of these foods that are given weighed, so that you can judge
approximately what your servings will total.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Mixture</i></div>
<p>A mixture of foods should be used, in order to get the different
elements which are necessary for the human machine. It is not
wholesome to have many foods at a meal; but the menu should be
varied from day to day.</p>
<p>Any regimen which does not allow some carbohydrates and fats for
the fuel foods is injurious if persisted in for a length of
time.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Thoroughly Masticate Everything</i></div>
<p>As to harmful combinations; there are not many, and if your food
is thoroughly masticated you need not concern yourself very much
about them. However, if you find a food disagrees with you, or that
certain combinations disagree, do not try to use them. Underweight
individuals sometimes have to train their digestive tracts for some
of the foods they need.</p>
<p>Coffee, tea and other mild stimulants are not harmful to the
majority; but, like everything else, in excess they will cause ill
health. Alcoholic drinks make the fat fatter and the thin thinner,
and both more feeble mentally.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>I Love Her</i></div>
<p>I hope I have stimulated you to an interest in dietetics. There
are many books which go into the subject much more deeply. I
recommend, especially, "The Home Dietitian," written by my beloved
colleague and classmate, Dr. Belle Wood-Comstock.</p>
<p>Others I have read that are especially suitable for the home are
"Feeding the Family," by Mary Schwartz Rose, and "Dietary
Computer," by Pope. There are doubtless many other good ones. The
Department of Agriculture publishes free bulletins on the subject.
Farmers' Bulletin No. 142, by Atwater, is very comprehensive.</p>
<p>Other authorities I have consulted are Lusk, Friedenwald and
Ruhr&auml;h, Gautier, Sherman, Buttner, Locke and Von Noorden.</p>

<p>White, gluten, rye, whole wheat, etc., practically same caloric
value per same weight. There is so little difference between the
caloric value of gluten bread and other breads that it is not
necessary for reducing to try to get it. (Toasted bread has the
same caloric value that it had before toasting. It is more easily
digested, but just as fattening. Advised, however, because it makes
you chew.)</p>

sugars (carbohydrates), and protein (the meat element), is 113.
This means fats are 2-1/4 times more fattening than other foods.

<h3>Vegetarianism vs. Meat Eating</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Protein</i></div>
<p>As protein is the only food which builds and repairs tissue, it
is the food which has caused the most controversy.</p>
<p>First: As to the amount needed.</p>
<p>Second: As to whether animal flesh protein is necessary.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Chittenden</i></div>
<p>AMOUNT NEEDED: It was thought for many years that 150 grams or 5
ounces of dry protein (equivalent to about 1-1/2 pounds lean meat)
per day was necessary. But experiments of Chittenden and others
have proved that considerably less is sufficient, and that the
health is improved if less is taken.</p>
<p>Chittenden's standard is 50 grams, or 1-2/3 ounces, dry protein
(equivalent to 1/2 pound meat per day). This is considered by many
as insufficient. A variation from 1-2/3 to 3 ounces dry protein per
day will give a safe range. (ROSE.)</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Approx. 240 to 360 C Per Day</i></div>
<p><i>The amount of protein needed is comparatively independent of
the amount of physical exertion</i>, thus differing from the purely
fuel foods, carbohydrates and fats, which should vary in direct
proportion to the amount of physical exertion. In general, 10 to 15
per cent of the total calories per day should be taken as protein.
An excess is undoubtedly irritant to the kidneys, blood vessels,
and other organs, and if too little is taken the body tissues will
suffer.</p>
<p>Not all of the protein should be taken in the form of animal
protein; at least one-half should be taken from the vegetable
kingdom.</p>
<p><i>Animal Flesh Protein</i></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Necessary?</i></div>
<p>The following are a few of the chief reasons given by those who
object to its use:</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Negative Side</i></div>
<p>First: The animal has just as much right to life, liberty, and
pursuit of happiness as we have.</p>
<p>Second: They may be diseased, and there is the possibility of
their containing animal parasites, such as tapeworms and
trichin&aelig;. I would like to tell you more about worms, they are
so interesting, but He says not to try to tell all I know in this
little book; that maybe he will let me write another sometime,
although it is a terrible strain on him, and that I have given
enough of the family history, anyway.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Some Word</i></div>
<p>Third: The tissues of animals contain excrementitious material,
which may cause excess acidity, raise the blood pressure, and so
forth.</p>
<p>Fourth: More apt to putrefy and thus give ptomaine
poisoning.</p>
<p>Fifth: Makes the disposition more vicious.</p>
<p>(Honest,&mdash;animals eating meat exclusively are more
vicious.)</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Affirmative Side</i></div>
<p>Those who believe that animal protein should be eaten answer
these points as follows:</p>
<p>First: Survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Second: If you give decent support to your health departments
they can furnish enough inspectors to prevent the marketing of
diseased meat; and if some should slip through, if you thoroughly
bake, boil, or fry your animal parasites they will lose their
pep.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/055.png" width="50%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>Third: Most of the harmful products are destroyed by the
intestines and liver.</p>
<p>Fourth: True, but see that you get good meat, and don't eat it
in excess.</p>
<p>Fifth: Unanswerable&mdash;to be proved later by personal
experiments.</p>
<p>In addition, they say that animal protein is more easily
digested, that 97 per cent is assimilated because it is animal, and
so it is much more to be desired, especially by children and
convalescents; that vegetable protein is enclosed in cellulose, and
only 65 to 75 per cent is used by the system; thus the diet is apt
to be too bulky if the proper amount is taken.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/056.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Strong Vegetarians</i></div>
<p>It has been proved, however, by several endurance tests, that
the vegetarian contestants had more strength and greater endurance
than their meat-eating competitors, so there is no reason why we
should be worried by one or two, or even more, meatless days,
especially when animal product protein, such as milk, eggs, cheese,
and the vegetable proteins, as in the legumes and the nuts, are
available.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Confession</i></div>
<p>I confess that for quite a while after studying vegetarian books
I took a dislike to meat, but now I am in the comfortable state
described by Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography. It seems that
he had been converted to vegetarianism and had decided that he
never again would eat the flesh of animals that had been ruthlessly
slaughtered, when they so little deserved that fate.</p>
<p>But he was exceedingly fond of fish, and while on a fishing
party, as some fish were being fried, he found they did smell most
admirably well, and he was greatly torn between his desire and his
principle. Finally he remembered that when the fish were opened he
saw some smaller fish in their stomachs, and he decided that if
they could eat each other he could eat them.</p>

<h3>The Deluded Ones&mdash;My Thin Friends</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>What!</i></div>
<p>I am going to sandwich you in between the food calories and my
fat friends, and maybe you can absorb some of them. In the first
chapter, you remember, I said I was not particularly interested in
you, but I have changed my mind, and I will treat you tenderly and
carefully. I will have to preach a little bit first, but I don't
mind that; I love to reform people&mdash;Yes, you need
reforming!</p>
<p>The first thing many of you have to do is to learn to accept the
trivial annoyances and small misfits of life as a matter of course,
for to give them attention <i>beyond their deserts</i> is to wear
the web of your life to the warp.</p>
<p>Elbert Hubbard never said anything better than that. Have that
reproduced in motto form and put it on your bureau, and repeat it
fifty times daily.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Good Philosophy</i></div>
<p>Adopt my philosophy. If I have a trivial annoyance I analyze it
carefully. Was I to blame? Yes? All right, I am glad, because then
I can see that it will not happen again, so I stop worrying. If I
am not to blame, if I could not help it in the least, well, then I
don't worry about it, for that will not help it any, and I wasn't
to blame! If it bobs up in my mind again, I say: "Now, look here,
you annoyance, I have given you all the attention you deserve;
avaunt, depart, get out!"</p>
<div class="figcenter"><br />
<img src="images/059.png" width="50%" alt="" title="" />
<br />
<br /></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Simple</i></div>
<p>Now, how is this philosophy going to help you gain?</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Lost Calories</i></div>
<p>When you worry needlessly, notice how tense your muscles are.
You are exercising them all of the time and using hundreds of
calories of energy. You raise your blood pressure, the internal
secretory glands may overact (re-read what I have said about these
glands in the fat people), and thus many more calories are used.
The intestinal secretions do not flow so freely, you have
indigestion and do not assimilate your food, and thus hundreds more
calories are lost.</p>
<p>It certainly is impossible to gain unless your food is
assimilated.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Develop Poise</i></div>
<p>So the first thing you have to learn is this mental control and
to relax. Remember that word, relax. After you are better nourished
your nervous system will not be on hair-trigger tension, and it
will be easier for you.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>No Pain In Matter; No Matter In Pain Why
Worry?</i></div>
<p>If you are ill in mind or body, remember that it is natural to
be well, and that within your body nature has stored the most
wonderful forces which are always tending towards the normal, or
health, if not obstructed or hindered.</p>
<p>Nature sometimes needs help to stimulate those forces, or to
reinforce them, or to remove obstructions. This is where the
physician comes in. But you yourself can aid nature the most by
realizing that <i>nature is health and it is normal to be well</i>.
By so doing, all of your organs function better and you are
restored to normal more rapidly.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sleep</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Fresh Air</i></div>
<p>Second: It is very important to have enough sleep. Dr. Richard
Cabot says that probably resistance is lowered as much by lack of
sufficient sleep as by any other factor, and that all you can soak
into your system in twenty-four hours is not too much. Don't forget
the fresh air.</p>
<p>You generally suffer from sleeplessness, I believe. The
overweights are always advised not to sleep too much. They will
find while reducing that they won't want to sleep so much, anyway.
They will like to stay awake&mdash;they feel so much happier.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sometimes</i></div>
<p>Now, when you retire and try to sleep but cannot, try
this&mdash;it works with me. You know when you are passing over
your mental images become distorted and grotesque. I artificially
induce that state. If I find myself rehearsing about two hundred
times, with appropriate gestures, the keen, witty, logical remarks
which I could have made in favor of my pet legislation in the club
discussion, but didn't, then I begin after this fashion:</p>
<p>Pink elephants with green ribbons on their tails&mdash;red
rhinoceri (is that right, or should it be
rhinoceroses?)&mdash;smiling peanuts&mdash;Woman's City
Club&mdash;Social Health Insurance&mdash;why didn't I say&mdash;I
wish I had said&mdash;(here get out, you annoyance!)&mdash;pink
elephants&mdash;and so forth and so forth.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Picture of Pink Elephant Adorned</i></div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/062.png" width="50%" alt=""
title="" />
<br /></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Woe Is Me</i></div>
<p>Now I realize I have ruined myself. I am my own worst enemy. I
have exposed my whole life before those modern vivisectionists, the
army of amateur psycho-analysts.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Exercise</i></div>
<p>Third: Exercise. Great muscular exertion should be avoided, but
the setting-up exercises that I advise, if begun with moderation
and increased gradually, will undoubtedly stimulate the appetite
and help the body functions to be better performed.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Food</i></div>
<p>Fourth: Since food is the only source of body substance, you
must gradually train your stomach so that it can care for enough
food to not only supply your bodily energy, but to leave a little
excess to be stored as fat.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Your Stomach</i></div>
<p>If you have a small appetite&mdash;and many of you
have&mdash;your stomach is undoubtedly contracted, and you must
gradually add to the amount you have been eating, even though it
may cause some distress, until you have disciplined it so that it
can handle what you need without distress. The stomach is a
muscular organ and can be trained and exercised somewhat as other
organs can. You will not have much appetite at first, but it will
develop. Sometimes a short fast for a day or two, drinking nothing
but pure water, seems to be beneficial in the beginning.</p>
<p>Do not drink much with your meals, unless the drink has food
value by the addition of lots of cream or sugar, or both.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Eat More</i></div>
<p>Decide how many calories you need for your activities, gradually
add to your dietary until you have reached that number, and then
some more, and you will gain as surely as the overweight individual
will lose by doing the opposite. It may take a long time, or you
may get results very rapidly, depending somewhat upon the
individual characteristics. Gradually increase your butter, cream,
sugar, chocolate, and so forth, as they are very high in food
value.</p>
<p>Study the Key to the Calories and reckon your calories every day
for a while. You have already noticed that the foods that you like
are low in food value.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things you can take to add to your
fuel:</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Try Some of These</i></div>
<p>A glass of milk, hot or cold, taken between meals and before
retiring, will add about 500 calories.</p>
<p>Cream sauce on your vegetables will add to their value.</p>
<p>Cod liver oil, or olive oil, or cream, begun in small doses and
gradually increased.</p>
<p>One malted milk, made with milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped
cream, and the malted milk, will add about 500 calories.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Learned Phraseology</i></div>
<p>You remember the painful time that I spoke of when there was so
much more of me than there ought to be? Well, the aforesaid
concoction, made with milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped cream,
and the malted milk, was accessory before the fact, and also
particeps criminis before the law.</p>
<p>I absorbed this phraseology by being president of the
Professional Woman's Club, with its high-class women attorneys,
ministers, dentists, Ph.D.'s, and "Medical Trust" doctors.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Explanatory Note 1</i></div>
<p>"Medical Trust."&mdash;The American Medical Association
(A.M.A.), a powerful trust you can't get into unless you have a
high preliminary education and are a graduate of a high-class
medical college. Eleven years' training after the grammar school is
their minimum standard now.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Explanatory Note 2</i></div>
<p>"League for Medical Ignorance."&mdash;The so-called "League for
Medical Freedom"; the opponent of the above mentioned trust. Their
standard&mdash;any old kind of a medical or religious training, two
weeks or longer, engrafted on anyone who has the money to pay for
the course. No education, no barrier; in fact, those of limited
education make the loudest boosters for the league. In justice, I
must say that many splendid, estimable persons belong to this
league, not knowing these facts.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Thorough Mastication</i></div>
<p>Fifth: See page 92 in my advice to the fat. It is as important
for you as for them. (It always makes me mildly furious when I look
up a word and am directed to seek some other locality. If it
affects you that way&mdash;seek page 60 in my advice to you.)</p>
<p>Also have your teeth X-rayed. Blind abscesses at the roots will
cause all sorts of aches and pains, as well as underweight.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Especially About Your Ailments</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Organ Recitals Wednesday Evenings
Only</i></div>
<p>Sixth: <i>Don't talk so much</i>. See if you can't leave out
two-thirds of the totally unimportant, uninteresting details. A
tremendous amount of energy is used in talking. This habit I would
not say was confined to you, by any means; it is another one of
those pretty nearly universal errors.</p>
<p>I will not give you a sample fattening menu, for it might be all
out of proportion to what you could handle, and it would upset you.
Make out your own menus, realizing that you must work gradually to
the desired amount.</p>
<p>I am taking it for granted that you are organically sound, that
your scientific, educated physician has said there is nothing the
matter with you, except perhaps your "nervous" disposition.</p>
<p>Have I not been nice to you? All right, relax and watch yourself
get into the class of the plumptically adequate.</p>
<p>And if you don't succeed after a faithful trial, take the
milk-cure, with its three to six weeks' absolute rest.</p>

you thin.<br />

<h2><a name="Chapter7" id="Chapter7"></a>7</h2>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>It is practically impossible to reduce weight through exercise
alone, unless one can do a tremendous amount of it. For the food
that one eats is usually enough to cover the energy lost by the
exercise.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Light On Your Feet</i></div>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/068.png" width="50%" alt=""
title="" />
<br /></div>
<p>However, exercise is a very important feature of any reducing
program; not because of the fat that is burned up in the
exercise&mdash;and there is some burned&mdash;but for the reason
that it is necessary to keep one in a healthy condition. The
muscles, the internal organs, the bones, the brain, are all

<p>The exercises described hereinafter will help make you fat or
thin, and they will keep you supple, graceful, and light on your
feet, so that when I tell my husband that he must dance with you,
Madam, he will not say, "Nothing stirring," and when you,
Professor, ask me to dance, I will not curse the day I was
born.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Warning</i></div>
<p>If you have not been accustomed to exercise, I warn you to take
up only one or two at a time and do each one a few times only. You
will be atrociously sore, and you will realize that you have
muscles of which you wotted not.</p>
<p>However, persist, if you are sure there are no organic reasons
why you shouldn't&mdash;such as a weak heart. (In case you are very
much overweight, I think it advisable to wait until you have
reduced somewhat.)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Or Classic Dancing</i></div>
<p>It is splendid if you can belong to a gymnasium or to a physical
culture class, but ten to fifteen minutes' systematic daily
exercise practiced with vim, and each set followed by deep
breathing, will do more good than a gymnasium spasmodically
attended. Brisk walking with a long stride isn't so bad; in fact,
if taken with a very long stride it will twist 'most every organ
you have in your body.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/070a.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>There are hundreds of exercises you can take. If you will notice
little rascal's illustrations you will find many good ones. Those
illustrating the beginning of this chapter are excellent.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/070b.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" /></div>
<p>If possible, it is best to take the exercises on arising in the
morning, but if you have a household to care for you may not be
able to do so. For those who have to do their own work, it may be
well to do the work first. You can do it in half the time if you
plan it carefully and speed up. (This advice is not for my thin
friends; their speedometers register too high already.) It does not
matter so much when the exercises are done as that they are done,
and done every day for the rest of your life, with the possible
exception of two or three days a month.</p>
<p>Gallstones, permanent stiff joints, and other little things like
that will have a hard time forming.</p>

<p>(The services of my noted artist I was able to obtain with great
difficulty, as he was engaged in the more important work of making
a swagger stick. I finally secured him by the promise of an ice
cream cone and twenty-three cents to go with his two cents so that
he could buy a Thrift Stamp. He is given due credit on the title

<h3>At Last! How to Reduce</h3>
<p>The title of this chapter indicates to whom it is addressed. All
others please refrain from reading, for it is strictly private and
confidential, and is intended only for those who need it.</p>
<p>You thin and you normal had better save it, though, for you may
qualify later. You are keeping right on reading now! I'm surprised.
I wanted to tell my fat friends that the first thing they have to
do is to get control of their will power, and now I can't do
it.</p>
<p>Somehow, will power with a layer of fat on it gets feeble. Don't
laugh, you too thin! It gets worse than feeble, if there is no fat
at all and the nervous system is starved, it&mdash;well, I won't
say what it does, for I don't want to worry you.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Now That Order Is Restored I Will
Resume</i></div>
<p>Will power, being feeble to a greater or less degree, must be
bolstered and aided a bit, to begin with, so&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Watch Your Weight!</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Nature Always Counts</i></div>
<p>Tell loudly and frequently to all your friends that you realize
that it is unpatriotic to be fat while many thousands are starving,
that you are going to reduce to normal, and will be there in the
allotted time. If you belong to a club, round up the overweights
and form a section. Call it the "Watch Your
Weight&mdash;Anti-Kaiser Class." Tax the members sufficiently to
buy a good, accurate pair of scales. Meet once a week to weigh.
Wear approximately the same weight clothes, and weigh at the same
time in relation to eating. Do this whether or not you belong to a
club. Once or twice a week is often enough to weigh. Scales vary,
so try to use the same ones.</p>
<p>Don't be discouraged if some day after you have dieted well you
seem to have gained. Nature sometimes seems fiendish that way. The
excess weight is probably due to a retention of water, and will not
be permanent. However, don't depend upon this too often! Usually,
if you have gained when you think you ought not to, it is because
Nature has been counting calories and you haven't.</p>
<p>Have the members listed on a weight chart conspicuously placed
near the scales, and record accurately the weight weekly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>No Funds for the Red Cross</i></div>
<p>Those not reducing at least one pound per week to be fined
soundly and the proceeds given to the Red Cross. That won't be a
good way to raise funds for the chapter, though, for there will be
no fines after the first week or so, when the members find what
their maintenance diet should be and are consuming less than
that.</p>
<p>I will explain this maintenance diet business. You shameless
thin ones, call back your more polite comrades&mdash;this is
important for all of you. (I shall also tell you more fully about
this in the last chapter.)</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Maintenance Diet</i></div>
<p>The maintenance diet is one which maintains you at your present
weight, <i>i.e.,</i> you are not gaining or losing. You may be over
or under normal, but are staying there. The intake equals the
outgo.</p>
<p>When you eat less than your maintenance diet, you are going to
supply the deficiency with your own fat.</p>
<p>So commit yourself on your honor that you are going to reduce or
perish&mdash;no joke; you can't tell how near you are to it if you
are much overweight. There are two general stages of fatty heart.
In the first stage the heart is surrounded by a blanket of fat, and
it also penetrates between the muscles. Later, if it goes on too
long, the heart muscle itself degenerates to fat, then&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Good-night!</i></div>
<p>Shakespeare warns you to make thy body less, hence thy grace
more; leave gormandizing, and know that the grave doth gape for
thee thrice wider than for other men.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><br />
<img src="images/079.png" width="30%" alt="" title="" />
<br />
<br /></div>
<h3><i>Second Order</i></h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Shrink Your Stomach</i></div>
<p>Your stomach, long used to an excess of food for your
needs&mdash;it may not be a large amount&mdash;but still, I repeat,
being used to an excess of food for your needs, your stomach must
be disciplined. It is undoubtedly distended, as it should not
be.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Shrink Your Stomach</i></div>
<p>A good way to show it that you are master is to fast for at
least one day&mdash;drink nothing but pure water, hot or cold, as
you prefer. It will protest vociferously and will tell all its
friends, the different organs of your body, how you are persecuting
it, and they will join the league against you and decide they will
oust you from your position, and you will feel like&mdash;but don't
mind it; it will soon know that you mean business, and, much
chastened and considerably contracted, will take the next day a
very small amount of food very gratefully.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Shrink Your Stomach</i></div>
<p>If you do not want to be so severe with it you can allow it five
glasses of hot or cold skim milk or buttermilk, one every three
hours, say, at 10,1,4,7, and 10 o'clock. One glass is 80 calories,
five equal 400 calories, which is not so much.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Or Mashed</i></div>
<p>The baked potato and glass of skim milk diet, three times a day
one day a week, which has its devotees, depends upon its low
caloric content for its results. There is no magic in it, no yeast
business which reduces. This is most wholesome, however, for
potatoes contain a large amount of the potassium salts, which tend
to counteract the effects of uric acid, and thus are good for the
gouty type.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Mono-Diets</i></div>
<p>The beefsteak, the milk, and the fruit diets are also good. One
can gain as well as lose on the milk diet, all depending on number
of calories consumed, and it is an excellent method for both. The
beefsteak diet is beneficial for a short time, but too much protein
over a long period has been shown to be harmful. An exclusive fruit
diet is excellent for reduction.</p>
<p>Low calorie days can be repeated once a week if necessary in
order to keep the stomach in good order. Fruit juice, one-quarter
glass, or fresh fruit, can be substituted for the skim milk, and
you may prefer it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>But You Do Not Have To</i></div>
<p>You could keep on this for some time, or fast for some time, and
probably be much benefited. I fasted five days once, or rather
fruit-juiced five days. I lost about ten pounds, I think, and my
heart, which had begun to carry on, was relieved.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sob Stuff</i></div>
<p>It was during that period of which I have spoken, and of which I
am ashamed; for I had my M.D. degree then and should have known
better. But you know we have good authority that it is easier to
teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of twenty to
follow our own teaching.</p>
<h3><i>Third Order</i></h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>You Are Down to Business</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>And Maybe Diabetes</i></div>
<p>Now you will have to reckon on the amount of food or number of
calories you need per day. Review the rule I have given. You find
for your age and <i>normal weight</i> that you will need, let us
say for example, 2200 calories. You have probably been consuming
twice that amount and either storing it away as fat or as disease.
(It is surprising how small an excess will gradually add up pounds
of fat. For instance, three pats of butter or three medium
chocolate creams a day, if over the maintenance limit, would add
approximately <i>27 pounds a year</i> to your weight!)</p>
<p>Now you are to reduce your maintenance diet&mdash;the 2200
calories we are taking for example&mdash;to 1200
calories&mdash;quite a comfortable lot, you will find.</p>
<p>You will be surprised how much 1200 calories will be if the food
is judiciously selected.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>After All, Hunger Is Much More Agreeable
Than Apoplexy</i></div>
<p>You may be hungry at first, but you will soon become accustomed
to the change. I find that dry lemon or orange peel, or those
little aromatic breath sweeteners, just a tiny bit, seem to stop
the hunger pangs; or you may have a cup of fat-free bouillon or
half an apple, or other low calorie food. (Count the calories
here.)</p>
<p>One thousand calories less food per day equals four ounces of
fat lost daily&mdash;approximately 8 pounds per month. If you do
not want to lose so fast, do not cut down so much.</p>
<h3><i>Fourth Order</i></h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>You Register Joy</i></div>
<p>You may eat just what you like&mdash;candy, pie, cake, fat meat,
butter, cream&mdash;but&mdash;<i>count your calories!</i> You can't
have many nor large helpings, you see; but isn't it comforting to
know that you can eat these things? Maybe some meal you would
rather have a 350-calorie piece of luscious pie, with a delicious
150-calorie tablespoonful of whipped cream on it, than all the
succulent vegetables Luther Burbank could grow in California.</p>
<p>My idea of heaven is a place with me and mine on a cloud of
whipped cream.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>You Registered Too High</i></div>
<p>Now that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to
make your menus containing very little of them.</p>
<h3><i>Fifth Order</i></h3>
<p>This is going to be your chief business and pursuit in life for
the next few months, this reducing of your weight. However, keep up
your Red Cross and all other activities, fast and furiously, so
that you won't be thinking about yourself.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>More Warnings</i></div>
<p>Don't reduce more than two or three pounds a week; two or less
is better. If you are too cannibalistic, your heart, kidneys and
nervous system are liable to suffer&mdash;you yourself are
supplying too much fat in your dietary, and there are other
scientific reasons against reducing too rapidly.</p>
<p>However, you may find that the first week or so you may reduce
five or seven pounds; but don't worry about this, for that is a
slushy, watery fat that goes easily.</p>
<p>If a claim like a cold should attack you, and after spraying
nose and throat frequently with an antiseptic, and then denying the
claim vigorously, it persists in running a severe course, better go
back to maintenance diet for a few days.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Not Even While Cooking</i></div>
<p><i>Don't "taste"!</i> You will find the second taste much harder
to resist than the first. If you have allowed in your daily program
something between meals (a good plan), take it, but not
otherwise.</p>
<p>Try not to overeat at any time, and thus undo the work that
perhaps has taken you two or three days to accomplish. It will be
all right occasionally, possibly one day a week, to eat up to your
maintenance diet, but don't, I beg of you, go over it so that you
will gain.</p>
<p>You will be tempted quite frequently, and you will have to
choose whether you will enjoy yourself hugely in the twenty minutes
or so that you will be consuming the excess calories, or whether
you will dislike yourself cordially for the two or three days you
lose by your lack of will power.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>I Ought Not to Do This</i></div>
<p>I am afraid I am going to tell a story. I feel as though I were,
and I don't want to. It is one I heard years ago at a teachers'
convention at Riverside, when I was a tender, unsuspecting young
school teacher, so it is perfectly good, albeit senile&mdash;and it
illustrates my point so well&mdash;so well&mdash;well, you have to
put yourself in the place of the little chaps, Billie and Johnnie,
of the kindergarten.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Little Anatomical Story</i></div>
<p>It seems it was customary to bring a lunch, and Little-new-boy
had come without one. Teacher asked Billie would he share? No,
sturdily; not he. But little Johnnie, he would. Some time later,
Johnnie, with a frantic waving of his hand, and with just pride in
his generosity, informed the class that he had shared his lunch
with Little-new-boy and he felt good is his little heart.</p>
<p>Billie stood his ground and stoutly declared that he ate his and
he felt good in his little belly.</p>

<h3>Autobiographical</h3>
<p>I did not give our thin friends a sample menu for fear it would
upset them; but nothing can upset your digestion, I know. However,
I will not give you a sample menu, either, but will tell you what I
eat when I go on a reduction regime, which for me is 1200
Calories.</p>
<p>You will notice, most of my calories I have at dinner in the
evening. You may not like this, but would rather have yours spread
over the entire day; and you can suit your fancy, for it makes no
difference as long as your total number per day stays within your
reduction limit.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Make Out Several Menus if You
Like</i></div>
<p>Don't think you have to follow my menu. You might gain on it!
Study the Key and select your own.</p>
<p>Many will lose by going on the no-breakfast plan, or the
no-lunch plan. If they do reduce, it is because they have lowered
their daily consumption of food, and not because of the
no-breakfast or no-lunch plan <i>per se.</i></p>
<p>Fat seems to melt faster when the chief meal is in the middle of
the day, and with only 200 or 300 calories of fruit for the evening
meal. In this way you slim while you sleep.</p>

<p>That leaves me 50 more calories to total 1200, to take before
retiring if I am hungry. You should leave this 50 calories to take
before retiring, because if you are hungry you will find it very
difficult to go to sleep.</p>
<p>A small cup of hot skimmed milk tends to be a sedative. Hunger,
like cold feet, is hard to go to sleep on.</p>

thorough mastication.</i></p>

<p>This applies to the thin as well as to the fat, and to the child
as well as to the adult. Take a moderate mouthful and rassel with
it until it is automatically swallowed. Chew until it is all gone
before you put any more in your mouth. There is no better way of
jollying yourself into thinking that you have had all you want than
this Fletcherizing habit, and it takes the same time to consume
one-half the amount of food you have been in the habit of
eating.</p>
<p>I will allow you all the water you want, in reason; in fact, I
advise it while you are reducing, both at the meals and between
meals. The only precaution is that at the meals it should not be
drunk while food is in the mouth, for this would tend to lessen
thorough mastication.</p>
<p>Now, Madam and Madam's husband, when are you going to begin this
important business of reducing? After the holidays? Tomorrow?
<i>No! Right now.</i> The sooner you get started, the better. The
chief thing to do, and the hardest, is to get started and to get
the habit. After the first three days you will not dread it; in
fact; you will feel so much better that you will not be willing to
go back to your old habits of overeating.</p>
<p>Now let's review a bit what you are to do.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Plan the Day Before</i></div>
<p>First: Pledge yourself to yourself, and to someone else, so you
will be ashamed to fail. There is a great deal of psychology to
reducing. Use strong auto-suggestion. Decide just how much you are
going to eat in advance of the meal&mdash;so many calories, <i>no
more!</i> This sounds foolish, but it helps wonderfully.</p>
<p>Second: Begin with a fast or a low caloric diet for the first
day; keep it, if necessary, one day weekly.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Low Bridge on Fats and Pastries</i></div>
<p>Third: Study food list and make out menus the caloric totals of
which <i>are less</i> than your maintenance diet. Have a fairly
balanced diet, some fat, some carbohydrates, some protein, and a
good amount of green vegetables and fruit. <i>Have 200-300 C's of
protein.</i></p>
<p>Fourth: Masticate every morsel with such thoroughness that it is
automatically swallowed.</p>
<p>Fifth: Keep up your activities&mdash;Red Cross and other relief
work.</p>
<p>Sixth: Remember that you will feel good in your little heart
when you resist temptation to overeat, and when you don't, you
won't feel good anywhere.</p>
<p>Seventh: Some vigorous exercise every day.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>There Is Life Substance and Intelligence
in Chocolate Creams!</i></div>
<p>NOTE: If there comes a time when you think you will die unless
you have some chocolate creams, go on a c.c. debauch. I do,
occasionally, and will eat as many as ten or so; but I take them
before dinner, then me for the balance of my dinner&mdash;</p>

<p>And thus, you see, every supposed pleasure in sin (eating) will
furnish more than its equivalent of pain (dieting) until belief in
material life (chocolate creams) is destroyed.</p>

<p>On re-reading this literary gem, humorous classic, and

have a very intimate mixture of the thins and the fats. But that is
as it should be for balance. I had intended to keep you strictly
separate, but the preaching, the exercises, the dry definitions,
the Key to the Calories, and so forth, was matter that was
applicable to both, so it could not be done.</p>

<h3>Maintenance Diet and Conclusions</h3>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/101.png" width="40%" alt=""
title="" />
<br />
<br /></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>1st Circle</i></div>
<p>THE HEAVY circle represents the amount of daily food (number of
calories) which will maintain you at present weight. It may be your
weight is too much or too little, but this is your maintenance diet
for that weight.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>2nd Circle</i></div>
<p>THE SECOND circle represents a daily diet containing more than
necessary for maintenance; for example, let us say 1000 calories
more. This 1000 calories of food is equivalent to approximately 4
ounces of fat [1000&divide;255 (1 oz. fat = 255 C.)]; 4 ounces of
fat daily equals 8 pounds a month which will be added to your
weight, and, if not needed by the system, will deposit itself as
excess fat.</p>
<p>Or the toxins arising from the unnecessary food will irritate
the blood vessels, causing arterio-sclerosis (hardening of the
arteries), which in turn may cause kidney disease, heart disease,
or apoplexy (rupture of artery in the brain), and maybe death
before your time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are underweight and the added
nourishment is gradually worked up to, it will improve the health
and cause a gain of so much (theoretically, and in reality if kept
up long enough).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>3d Circle</i></div>
<p>THE THIRD circle represents a diet containing less than the
maintenance; again, for example, say 1000 calories less. Here the
1000 calories must be taken from the body tissue, and fat is the
first to go, for fat is virtually dead tissue.</p>
<p>This 4 ounces of fat daily which will be supplied by your body
equals in six months 48 pounds.</p>
<p>There are in America hundreds of thousands of overweight
individuals; not all so much overweight as this, but some
considerably more so. If these individuals will save 1000 calories
of food daily by using their stored fat, think what it would mean
at this time.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Savings</i></div>
<p>Not only an immense saving of food to be sent to our soldiers
and allies and the starving civilians, and of money which could be
used for Liberty Bonds, the Red Cross, and other war relief work,
but a great saving and a great increase in power; for there is no
doubt that by reducing as slowly and scientifically as I have
directed, efficiency and health will be increased one hundred
fold.</p>
<p>If, as illustrated in the third circle, the 1000 calories or
less is eaten and the individual already is underweight, with no
excess fat, then this amount will be taken from the muscles and the
more vital tissues, and the organism will finally succumb. Before
this time is reached there will be a great lowering of resistance,
and the individual will be a prey to the infectious diseases.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that in children the growth of the whole
body is tremendously active, and especially that of the heart and
nervous system.</p>
<p>If the nervous system is undernourished, it becomes disorganized
and undeveloped. This is apt to be expressed in uncertain emotional
states, quick tempers, and a predisposition to convulsions. The
heart, if undernourished, lays its foundation for future heart
disease, and the whole system will be injured for life.</p>
<p>Anything that impairs the vigor and vitality of children strikes
at the basis of national welfare.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Food Administration Emphasizes
This</i></div>
<p>You can see from this how extremely important it is that, in our
need for the conservation of food, only those who can deny
themselves and at the same time improve their health and
efficiently should do it. It will be no help in our crisis if the
health and resistance of our people be lowered and the growth and
development of our children be stunted.</p>
<p>We, the hundreds of thousands of overweight citizens, combined
with the hundreds of thousands of the normal who are overeating to
their ill, can save all the food that is necessary. We are anxious,
willing, eager to do this. Now we know how, and we will.</p>

<h3>Three Years Later</h3>
<p><i>February, 1, 1921</i></p>
<p>An Added Chapter in Which Are Offered Twenty-one Suggestive
Menus</p>
<p>After nearly two years with the American Red Cross in the
Balkans I return to find the little book has been carrying on in my
absence&mdash;I write this for the fifth edition&mdash;and my
publishers insisting that I must furnish some more menus. They
affirm that there are many who do not care to or cannot figure out
their own.</p>
<p>After being so long under military discipline I obey now
instinctively, although I do not want to do this. But you know
publishers. They say that if there are menus for those who do not
have the desire to compute them, the usefulness of the book will be
increased. Publishers are so altruistic.</p>
<p>Now far be it from me to scorn the possibility of increased
sales myself. So I comply, and after you are reduced you will have
the energy and the increased keenness to scout around in the
calories and make out your own.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>A little of my Balkan experience in the reducing line may not be
amiss. In Albania, where I was stationed most of the time, life is
very strenuous. We all had to work hard and expend a great deal of
nervous energy. Medical calls on foot in the scorching sun over
unkind cobblestones, long distance calls on unkinder mules, long
hours in nerve-racking clinics, ferocious man-eating mosquitos,
scorpions, centipedes, sandflies, and fleas, and other unspeakable
animals kept us hopping and slapping and scratching.</p>
<p>But there was one consolation to me. With this work, more
intensive and more strenuous than I had ever done before, I would
not have to diet&mdash;I would not have to watch my weight&mdash;I
would not have to count my calories! Oh, joy!</p>
<p>We lived a community life, we Red Crossers. We had plain blunt
food, American canned mostly, supplemented with the fare that could
be eked out of Albania, and cooked by an Albanese who could not be
taught that we Americans were not Esquimos and did not like food
swimming in fat. However, it tasted good to famished Red Crossers,
and I ate three meals a day, confident that I would retain my
girlish middle-aged slenderness and not have to diet. We had no
scales and no mirrors larger than our hand mirrors. Our uniforms
were big and comfortable.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The French who are in charge of Scutari depart, the officers
leaving to us some of their furniture, including a full length
French plate mirror. Ordinarily when I look in a full-length mirror
I don't hate myself so much&mdash;so it is with some degree of
anticipated pleasure that I complacently approach, to get a
life-size reflection of myself after many months of deprivation of
that pleasure.</p>
<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" I exclaim. "<i>Bogomi</i>!"
(Serbian&mdash;'For the love of Allah!') "This is no mirror," I
mutter. "This is one of those musee things that make you look like
a Tony Sarg picture of Irvin Cobb."</p>
<p>"What's irritating you, Dockie?" asks one of the girls, coming
up and standing back of me. I look at her reflection. She does not
look like Irvin Cobb!</p>
<p>"Peggy," I say tragically, "Peggy, do I look like my
reflection?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear, we have all noticed how stout you have been getting.
Aren't you supposed to be some shark on the subject of ideal
weight?"</p>
<p>And the bitter truth is borne in upon me&mdash;no matter how
hard I work&mdash;no matter how much I exercise, no matter what I
suffer, I will always have to watch my weight, I will always have
to count my calories.</p>
<p>This is what I did then:</p>
<p>I stopped going to the breakfast table. I kept some canned milk
and coffee in my room, and made me two cups of coffee. For lunch I
ate practically what I wanted, limiting myself to one slice of
bread or one potato (we had no butter), with fruit for dessert. For
dinner I came down only when the dessert was being served, and had
a share of that with some coffee. I was jeered and derided. You
know how in community life we all are as disagreeable as we like,
and still love each other. Did not I know the desserts were the
most fattening part of the meal? I was some authority on how to
reduce, I was!</p>
<p>In vain I told them that it did not matter so long as my total
caloric intake did not equal the number that I needed. It was not
until some months after, when they saw that I was normal weight
again, that they began to realize I knew whereof I spoke.</p>
<p>Then came our withdrawal from Albania and release from duty.
After months of canned goods came Paris with its famous dishes;
Cr&egrave;me d'Isigny avec cr&egrave;me! Artichauts an beurre!
Patisseries francaises! Oo lala! Again I said calories be
<i>dashed</i>! I can reduce when I get home. I had no delusions
now, you see.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>And now I am home trying to help raise the funds for the
starving children of Central Europe, and explaining to my friends
that while there is a food shortage in Europe it is not because I
was there; and that I am reducing and the money that I can save
will help keep a child from starving, and that they can do the
same; that for every pang of hunger we feel we can have a double
joy, that of knowing we are saving worse pangs in some little
children, and that of knowing that for every pang we feel we lose a
pound. A pang's a pound the world around we'll say.</p>
<p>Every once in a while you hear that the caloric theory has been
exploded. There is no caloric "theory." Therefore none to explode.
Calories are simply units for measuring heat and energy and never
will be exploded any more than the yard or meter "theory" will be
exploded. Foods must contain essential salts and the growth and
health maintaining elements. These cannot be measured by calories.
The quantity of heat or energy production but not the quality of
the foods is measured in calories, and one must have a knowledge of
the qualities also. No scientifically educated individual has ever
thought otherwise.</p>
<p>The chief objection to following the advice of the numerous
laymen who write eat-and-grow-thin menus is that they advise the
elimination of all fats, sugars and starches. They lose sight of
the fact, or they do not know, that the obese individual&mdash;I
dislike that term &mdash;will have to have a balanced diet even
while reducing if he is to maintain his health. One will lose
weight on these menus, but as very many can testify they lose their
health also. One cannot live on an unbalanced diet for any length
of time without becoming unbalanced also. And furthermore the
over-weighter will always have to diet more or less, and will have
to have menus which he can continue to use. After normal weight is
reached he will not have to be nearly so abstemious, <i>but</i> the
same dietetic errors which produced overweight in the first place
will produce it again. So he must know something of dietetics and
he must have a balanced diet.</p>
<p>Now I shall make out some balanced menus, 1200 C's a day, being
careful to include a large amount of the leafy vegetables and some
milk or its products, the foods that McCollom calls PROTECTIVE
FOODS because they contain in a large measure the essential mineral
salts, and those vital elements he has called "Fat soluble A" and
"Water soluble B"&mdash;others call vitamines&mdash;which he has
proved to be so vital and necessary for growth in the young and the
maintenance of health in the adult. I shall also include 200-300
C's of protein.</p>
<p>The leafy vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, celery tops,
lettuce, onion, Swiss chard, turnip tops, and other leaves employed
as greens, water cress, etc., not only contain these vital
elements, but they also exert a favourable influence on sluggish
bowels and kidneys. They are low in caloric value, hence are low in
fat-producing properties, and can be consumed with indiscretion,
properly masticated.</p>
<p>It is better while you are reducing to stay away from the dining
table when you do not expect to eat. If you are rooming, get a tiny
sterno outfit, some substitute or coffee, some canned or dry milk,
some sugar if you use it, and you can make a hot drink in your room
and be independent for your breakfast and your evening meal, when
you decide some day to go without that. Do not take more than 100
calories for your breakfast. That leaves you 1100 calories to be
divided during the day if you go on a 1200 calorie schedule. I
suggest the following distribution of the calories:</p>
<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
<td>Breakfast</td>
<td>100 C's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lunch</td>
<td>350 "</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tea</td>
<td>100 "</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dinner</td>
<td>650 "</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br />
</div>
<p>You can reverse the dinner and lunch if you desire. If you do so
then have your 100 calories I have allowed for tea time to take
just before you retire. On a 1200 calorie schedule arranged as I
have it you will not be hungry, I assure you. It will not be more
than three or four days before your stomach will be shrunk and this
amount I have allowed you will almost seem like overeating! That is
the big idea. Shrink your stomach. Go on a fast or low calorie day
for a day if necessary to get started. See page 81.</p>
<p>I can safely say that any up and around adult will reduce on
1200 calories, for that will not supply the basal metabolism, i.e.,
the body's internal activities, such as the beating of the heart,
respiration, digestion, excretion, etc., and some of the body's
stored fat will be called upon to supply the deficiency. How much
one will reduce depends on how many calories are actually needed
for the internal and the external activities. See pages 26 and 27.
It is not advisable to reduce too rapidly. See page 85.</p>
<p>Now you have 1200 calories a day to eat. Let us think of this in
terms of money. You have a limited amount of money every day to
spend for food. You must spend it judiciously and get the food you
need and want. If you spend the most of it on one article you have
that much less for other things. It is possible that some days you
will want to spend more than your allowance and you draw on your
next day's supply. That will be all right if you remember that you
have done so and will spend that much less the next day to equalize

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
